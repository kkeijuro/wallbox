Compilable examples: 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12

to compile please enter the folder and execute:

g++ -std=c++14 exe_N.cpp -o exe

Where N is the number of the test, except in ex_5:

g++ -std=c++14 main.cpp exe_5.cpp -o exe

And execute exe file.

(std version may be less than c++14 for most of exercises) 

Future improvements:

.- Add cmakefile to compile all the examples
.- Add test for each exercise
